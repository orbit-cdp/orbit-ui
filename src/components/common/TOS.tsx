      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ marginBottom: '12px' }}>
        1.1. Blend is a non-custodial, peer-to-peer platform that allows users to access

        utilizing the Blend protocol (the “Protocol”). Defi transactions include borrowing and
        lending cryptoassets, backstopping lending pools, and claiming BLND tokens. While Script3
        developed the App and contributed to the Protocol, Script3 cannot take custody or control of
        any cryptoassets deposited on the Protocol, nor can Script3 upgrade or freeze smart
        contracts on the Protocol.

        Fees.

        unpredictably, and is entirely outside of the control of Script3. Although we attempt to
        provide accurate fee information, this informa¬tion reflects our estimates of fees, which
        may vary from the actual fees paid to use the App and interact with the Stellar blockchain.
        You acknowledge that under no circumstances will a transaction be invalidated, revocable,
        retractable, or otherwise unenforceable on the basis that the Stellar transaction fee for
        the given transaction was unknown, too high, or otherwise unacceptable to a user. You also
        acknowledge and agree that the Stellar transaction fee is non-refundable under all
        circumstances.

        decisions involving the App, you should seek independent professional advice from an
        individual who is licensed and qualified in the area for which such advice would be
        appropriate. The Terms are not intended to, and do not, create or impose any fiduciary
        duties on us. You further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are
        those set out expressly in these Terms.

      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ marginBottom: '12px' }}>
        10.1. Blockchain networks use public/private key cryptography. You alone are responsible for
        securing your private key(s). We do not have access to your private key(s). Losing control
        of your private key(s) will permanently and irreversibly deny you access to cryptoassets on
        the Stellar blockchain or other blockchain-based network. Neither Script3 nor any other
        person or entity will be able to retrieve or protect your cryptoassets. If your private
        key(s) are lost, then you will not be able to transfer your cryptoassets to any other
        blockchain address or wallet. If this occurs, then you will not be able to realize any value
        or utility from the cryptoassets that you may hold.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ marginBottom: '12px' }}>
        10.2. Cryptography is a progressing field with advances in code cracking or other technical
        advancements, such as the development of quantum computers, which may present risks to
        cryptoassets and the App, and could result in the theft or loss of your cryptoassets. We may
        also freeze the App in the event of a critical security problem, but this does not guarantee
        or otherwise ensure full security of the App.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ marginBottom: '12px' }}>
        10.3. The Stellar blockchain remains under development, which creates technological and
        security risks when using the App in addition to uncertainty relating to cryptoassets and
        transactions therein. You acknowledge that the cost of transacting on the Stellar blockchain
        is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on
        the Stellar blockchain, which may result in price fluctuations or increased costs when using
        the App.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ marginBottom: '12px' }}>
        10.4. The App remains under development, which creates technological, trading, and other
        risks when using or accessing the App. You acknowledge and understand that the App is
        subject to flaws and that you are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided by the
        App. These risks include, among others, an incorrect display of information on the App in
        the case of server errors. You acknowledge that these risks may have a material impact on
        your transactions using the App, which may result in, among other things, failing to fulfill
        transactions at your desired price or at all. This warning and others Script3 provides in
        these Terms in no way evidence or represent an on-going duty to alert you to all of the
        potential risks of using or accessing the App.

        complete, or current and may also include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. To
        continue to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible, information
        may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including, without limitation,
        information regarding our policies. Accordingly, you should verify all information before
        relying on it, and all decisions based on information contained on the App are your sole
        responsibility. No representation is made as to the accuracy, completeness, or
        appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing information distributed via the

        10.7. Transactions entered into in connection with the App are irreversible, final and there
        are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the App at your own
        risk. The risk of loss in trading cryptoassets can be substantial. You should, therefore,
        carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances
        and financial resources. By using or accessing the App, you represent and warrant that you
        have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your independent appraisal and
        investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the underlying cryptoassets. You
        represent and warrant that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication,
        professional advice, and experience to make your evaluation of the merits and risks of any
        transaction conducted in connection with the App or any digital asset. You represent that
        you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems and blockchain-based
        networks; cryptoassets, including the usage and intricacies of native cryptoassets, like
        Lumens (XLM); smart contract-based tokens, such as those that are issued on the Stellar
        blockchain; and systems that interact with blockchain-based networks. You accept all
        consequences of using the App, including the risk that you may lose access to your
        cryptoassets indefinitely. All transaction decisions are made solely by you. Notwithstanding
        anything in these Terms, we accept no responsibility whatsoever for, and will in no
        circumstances be liable to you in connection with, your use of the App for performing
        digital asset transactions.

        10.8. We must comply with Applicable Law, which may require us to, upon request by
        government agencies, take certain actions or provide information, which may not be in your
        best interests. The App and your cryptoassets could be impacted by one or more regulatory
        inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of Script3 to
        continue to make available any portion(s) of the App which rely on any Script3 proprietary
        software and, thus, could impede or limit your ability to access or use the App.

      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ marginBottom: '12px' }}>
        10.9. Cryptoassets currently face an uncertain regulatory landscape in the United States and
        many foreign jurisdictions. In the United States, cryptoassets are not subject to federal
        regulatory oversight but may be regulated by one or more state regulatory bodies. In
        addition, many cryptoasset derivatives are regulated by the Commodity Exchange Act and the
        regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
        (“CFTC”), and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has cautioned that many
        initial coin offerings are likely to fall within the definition of a security and subject to
        U.S. securities laws. One or more jurisdictions may, in the future, adopt laws, regulations
        or directives that affect cryptoasset networks and their users. Such laws, regulations or
        directives may impact the price of cryptoassets and their acceptance by users, merchants and
        service providers.

        12.1. Script3 does not operate a digital asset or derivatives exchange platform or offer
        trade execution or clearing services and, therefore, has no oversight, involvement, or
        control concerning your transactions using the App. All transactions between users of
        open-source software initially developed by Script3 are executed peer-to-peer directly
        between the users’ Stellar addresses through a smart contract. You are responsible for
        complying with all Applicable Laws that govern your use of the App, including, but not
        limited to, the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the

        not constitute advice or a recommendation concerning any commodity, security, or other
        digital asset or instrument. Script3 is not acting as an investment adviser or commodity
        trading adviser to any person or entity, nor is it registered with the SEC as either a

        14.1. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with

      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ marginLeft: '24px', marginBottom: '6px' }}>
        (a) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes (excluding claims for
        injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) between Script3 and any user that
        cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding
        arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless
        otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration
        Agreement applies to you and Script3, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents,
        employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or
        unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ marginLeft: '24px', marginBottom: '6px' }}>
        (b) Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party may seek
        arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute
        (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested
        relief. Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to service of process
        through personal service at their corporate headquarters, registered address, or primary
        address (for individuals or sole proprietors). Nothing in these Terms will affect the right
        of any party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law. After the Notice is
        received, you and Script3 may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and
        Script3 do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is
        received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement
        offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator
        has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.

      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ marginLeft: '24px', marginBottom: '6px' }}>
        (c) Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration
        Association (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”)
        that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate,
        the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider
        shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of
        initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict
        with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“Arbitration Rules”) governing the
        arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The
        arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where
        the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00)
        may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party
        seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten
        Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by
        the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your
        residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree
        otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties
        reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the
        award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If
        the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that
        Script3 made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, Script3 will pay you the greater
        of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees)
        and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees
        and costs of the ADR Provider.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ marginLeft: '24px', marginBottom: '6px' }}>
        (d) Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance based
        arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based
        solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating
        the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or
        witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ marginLeft: '24px', marginBottom: '6px' }}>
        (e) Time Limits. If you or Script3 pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be
        initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for
        filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ marginLeft: '24px', marginBottom: '6px' }}>
        (f) Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the
        rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Script3, and the dispute will not be consolidated
        with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have
        the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall
        have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief
        available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The
        arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential
        findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any
        damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual
        basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and

        (g) Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS
        TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, INSTEAD ELECTING THAT ALL
        CLAIMS AND DISPUTES SHALL BE RESOLVED BY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.
        ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE TYPICALLY MORE LIMITED, MORE EFFICIENT AND LESS COSTLY THAN RULES
        APPLICABLE IN A COURT AND ARE SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT. IN THE EVENT ANY
        LITIGATION SHOULD ARISE BETWEEN YOU AND SCRIPT3 IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN A SUIT TO
        VACATE OR ENFORCE AN ARBITRATION AWARD OR OTHERWISE, YOU WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL,
        INSTEAD ELECTING THAT THE DISPUTE BE RESOLVED BY A JUDGE.

        CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER.

        (i) Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to
        the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The
        parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph
        shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to
        enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable
        relief.

      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ marginLeft: '24px', marginBottom: '6px' }}>
        (j) Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law
        to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part
        or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the
        Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

        (n) Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek
        emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status
        quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any
        other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.

      <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ marginLeft: '24px', marginBottom: '6px' }}>
        (o) Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation,

        Arbitration Agreement.
